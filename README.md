Interactive  Dashboard
This project is an interactive fleet dashboard built using React, designed to visualize various fleet performance metrics. The dashboard displays key data such as asset efficiency, lorry type distributions, and violation statistics using charts and graphs (Pie and  Line charts). The visualizations are powered by Chart.js and Recharts. The app features a responsive layout, dynamic data updates, and is deployed on netlify for easy access and interaction.
